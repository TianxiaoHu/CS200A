    "## This Assignment\n",
    "In this homework, you will use what you've learned in class to create a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. In addition to providing some skeleton code to fill in, we will evaluate your work based on your model's accuracy and your written responses in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this homework, you should feel comfortable with the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature engineering with text data\n",
    "- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models\n",
    "- Validating the performance of your model and minimize overfitting\n",
    "- Generating and analyzing precision recall curves\n",
    "\n",
    "## Warning\n",
    "We've tried our best to filter the data for anything blatantly offensive as best as we can, but unfortunately there may still be some examples you may find in poor taste. If you encounter these examples and believe it is inappropriate for students, please let a TA know and we will try to remove it for future semesters. Thanks for your understanding!\n",

One idea is to compare the distribution of a single feature in spam emails to the distribution of the same feature in ham emails. If the feature is itself a binary indicator, such as whether a certain word occurs in the text, this amounts to comparing the proportion of spam emails with the word to the proportion of ham emails with the word.\n"

In order to get full credit on the accuracy part of this assignment, you must get at least **88%** accuracy on the test set. To see your accuracy on the test set, you will use your classifier to predict every email in the `test` DataFrame and upload your predictions to Kaggle.\n",

In most cases we won't be able to get both perfect precision (i.e. no false positives) and recall (i.e. no false negatives), so we have to compromise. For example, in the case of cancer screenings, false negatives are comparatively worse than false positives — a false negative means that a patient might not discover a disease until it's too late to treat, while a false positive means that a patient will probably have to take another screening.\n",

Then, to classify an example we say that an email is spam if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.5$ probability of being spam. However, *we can adjust that cutoff*: we can say that an email is spam only if our classifier gives it $\\ge 0.7$ probability of being spam, for example. This is how we can trade off false positives and false negatives.\n",
