However, if you have a variable in your code (such as `l` or `n`) then the `pdb` command takes precedence. So if you have a variable named `c` and you type `c` into `pdb`, you'll be issuing the `c(ontinue)` command which executes the program until it hits a breakpoint. Not exactly what we wanted right? A good practice in general is to give more informative variable names.\n",
