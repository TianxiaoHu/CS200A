    "\n",
    "Here are some important course policies. These are also located at\n",
    "http://www.ds100.org/fa18/.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaboration Policy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science is a collaborative activity. While you may talk with others about\n",
    "the homework, we ask that you **write your solutions individually**. If you do\n",
    "discuss the assignments with others please **include their names** at the top\n",
    "of your solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## This Assignment \n",
    "Welcome to the second project of Data 100! By this point in the course you have completed many assignments that are focused on a specific part of the data science lifecycle. From exploratory data analysis with the bike sharing dataset to feature engineering and modeling in spam/ham classification, you've learned the basics of many different segments of the data science lifecycle. In this project we combine all the individual segments and present a holistic representation of the entire lifecycle through the perspective of the NYC Taxi Rides dataset. We hope that with this project you will learn what the lifecycle looks like from beginning to end.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we will be using the NYC Taxi Rides dataset to predict ride duration given two external datasets: the NYC weather dataset and the NYC accidents dataset. This project will be broken down into multiple parts, each covering a core portion of the lifecycle. You have worked with many of these portions in previous assignments, but we will introduce a few more. The project will be broken down as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part A (Due Monday, 11/26, 11:59 PM)\n",
    "1. Data Wrangling\n",
    "    - Querying for data from a database using SQL\n",
    "    - Basic data cleaning using SQL/Pandas\n",
    "2. EDA, Visualization, Feature Engineering\n",
    "    - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC Taxi dataset\n",
    "    - Generate visualizations to gain insight on the dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an ethics notebook required for Part A.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part B (Due Friday, 11/30, 11:59 PM)\n",
    "3. External Datasets\n",
    "    - Exploratory data analysis of the NYC accidents dataset\n",
    "    - Join the taxi dataset with NYC accidents dataset, make connection and observation\n",
    "4. Feature Engineering and Model Fitting\n",
    "    - Feature engineering based on gained insights\n",
    "    - Modeling with sklearn data pipelines\n",
    "    - Submission to Kaggle\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also an extras notebook required for Part B.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Notebooks\n",
    "You may have noticed that in previous assignments we only used one notebook. You may also have noticed that these notebooks can get really long, making debugging, reproducibility, legibility, and portability harder. While it may not have made as much sense to split up some of the homeworks given that we are only looking at one dataset at one part of the lifecycle, it is generally good practice to divide up your notebooks into clear, organized compartments. Especially with this project, which is quite long, we will make good habits by separating our work into parts. In order to use our manipulated datasets across different parts of the project, we will be saving our tables into `.hdf` files and loading them when needed. We will help you through this in each of the parts, but feel free to save your own tables and use them wherever you like.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Kaggle\n",
    "We've created a Kaggle competition just for this project. Please sign up for Kaggle and join the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the link to join the Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/t/f8b3c6acc3a045cab152060a5bc79670.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Regarding Submissions - IMPORTANT, PLEASE READ\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment and future assignments (homework and projects) you will also submit your free response and plotting questions to Gradescope. To do this, you can download as PDF; there are two ways to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. File > Print Preview ----> Save website as PDF\n",
    "2. Control/Command + P ----> Save website as PDF\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "If you are having trouble with text being cut off in the generated PDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "- For cells containing text surrounded in triple quotes (e.g. \"\"\" Hello world \"\"\"), you can press enter in the middle of the string to push the text to a new line so that all the text stays within the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You are responsible for submitting and tagging your answers in Gradescope. For each free response and plotting question, please include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Relevant code used to generate the plot or inform your insights\n",
    "2. The written free response or plot\n",
    "\n",
    "## Final Words\n",
    "This project is long. Please be responsible and get started on this early! That being said, have fun! We are giving you lots of room for creating your own visualizations, for engineering your own features, and for choosing how you use the data to gain insights. Giving you this freedom is meant to help you develop your critical thinking skills and data science intuition. We also highly recommend coming to office hours, not only to get help but to also bounce some ideas off of us so we can point you in the right direction. Thanks for reading through all of this and good luck!"
